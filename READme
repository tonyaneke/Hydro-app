## Introduction

Welcome to Hydro App, your hydration companion! This React Native app is designed to remind you to stay hydrated throughout the day using background notifications and a convenient stop notification function.

## Features

- **Background Notifications:** Hydro App sends you timely hydration reminders even when the app is not actively running, ensuring you never miss a sip of water.

- **Stop Notification Function:** Don't want a notification right now? No problem! Easily stop notifications temporarily with a single tap.

## Why Hydration Matters

Proper hydration is essential for your health and well-being. Dehydration can lead to various health issues, including headaches, fatigue, and poor concentration. Hydro App is here to help you maintain optimal hydration levels effortlessly.

## Implementation

Hydro App leverages the power of React Native and Expo Push Notifications to provide you with seamless background notifications. Here's how it works:

1. **Expo Push Notifications:** We've integrated Expo's notification system to ensure reliable delivery of hydration reminders, even when the app is running in the background.

2. **Custom Stop Notification Function:** To give you control over notifications, we've added a user-friendly stop notification function within the app. Just tap the "Pause" button to temporarily halt reminders.

3. **Scheduled Reminders:** Hydro App schedules notifications at regular intervals throughout the day, personalized to your hydration needs.
